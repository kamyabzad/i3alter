#+title: i3alter

You could use i3alter to add alt-tab (switching to other workspaces in a LIFO order) behaviour to your i3wm.

* Installation
Install dependencies using either ~pip install -r requirements.txt~ or ~poetry install~.

* Usage
After running ~i3alter/i3alter.py~, hold ~alt~ and press ~<tab>~ or ~<shift>-<tab>~ to cycle between workspace. 

You'd probably want i3alter to run on startup, and also you wouldn't want alt+Tab and alt+Shift+Tab to be captured by other apps, so put the following lines in your i3 config file (~/.config/i3/config~):

#+begin_src
bindsym mod1+Tab exec "false"
bindsym mod1+Shift+Tab exec "false"

exec_always PATH/TO/REPO/i3alter/i3alter.py
#+end_src
